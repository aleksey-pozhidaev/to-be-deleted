FREQUENCY RANGE RECORDED: 	20MHz, center freq=915MHz
FFT SIZE: 					65535
FFT FRAME RATE: 			1000 frames / sec

Frequency hopping - each RF packet (the RED RECTANGLE) is between 19msec and 78msec in duration (vertical scale)
Each RF packet is modulated with Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS). The CSS deviation is 400kHz. The RF data rate is 3kHz.
The frequency channel separation is 603kHz. In the 20MHz frequency range recorded should be up to 33 frequency channels.
